GitHub is a necessary for a programming portfolio. GitHub helps you to
show employers what you are capable of programming. For example, I could
tell someone that I like to lift weights or I could go to the gym often.
This example shows that you truly are capable of what you claim. This 
also helps you to get a job that you may not have because they can see
your skill without having to hire you first. A programming portfolio
also helps you to practice coding with projects. With GitHub you can even
have a website to demonstrate your skill as a programmer. Overall, having a
programming portfolio on GitHub is great because you can show and
practice what you know. Both of those actions will help you to get a job.
