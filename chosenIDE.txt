The IDE that I decided to use is VSCode. First, I chose VSCode because
the UI looks modern and friendly. I also like how easy the plugin system is.
Since I program multiple languages VSCode makes that easy. All I have to do 
is go to the plugin tab and look up the plugin for my languages. Once I install
them then I am good to go. The VIM keybinds are just as easy to add. I just
look up the VIM plugin and I am good to go. I really like the debugger in VSCode
as well. VSCode is good for my coding needs. It is customizable yet simple.
