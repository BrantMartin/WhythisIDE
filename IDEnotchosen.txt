I chose not to use the Eclipse IDE for multiple reasons. First, I did not like how most of the IDE
was filled with space that could not have text by default. The UI felt very cramped. The UI also
looked very old unlike other IDE's that have a nice modern look to them. Eclipse is also used for
Java mainly which is not good for my use case. I program multiple languages right now, so I need
an IDE that can support many languages easily. Lastly, I like to use VIM keybinds while I code and it
does not seem easy to put those keybinds into Eclipse.
